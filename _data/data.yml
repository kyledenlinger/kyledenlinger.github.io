         In this role, I lead and manage diverse projects in digital classroom publications and Open Educational Resources (OER) on a small team dedicated to campus-wide engagement with digital scholarship and digital humanities. Key responsibilities include: 
         - Collaborate with faculty to develop and implement digital publishing and OER projects in their classes, emphasizing accessibility, copyright, and privacy concerns.
         - Write and manage project charters and other documentation to ensure timely project execution, clarify stakeholder roles and expectations, and align services with project goals, timelines, and stakeholder capacity.
         - Build wireframes, prototypes, and templates for projects requiring custom site development. Work with developers to create custom integrations where necessary. 
         - Facilitate workshops, write documentation, and respond to help tickets for a range of digital tools like PubPub, TimelineJS, WordPress, Pressbooks, Zotero, Airtable, and Hypothesis. 
         - Support the research and teaching needs of students and faculty in assigned academic departments through conducting library instruction sessions, writing job aids and research guides, offering one-on-one consultations, and responding to help tickets.
         - Serve on numerous campus and library committees, including the university's Committee on Information Technology and the library's UX Committee.
         
         *Accomplishments*
         - Played a central role in aligning and coordinating the university's emergency remote and fully-online teaching efforts during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, including creating and managing a Slack workspace for relevant support teams and co-developing and co-facilitating a peer-to-peer faculty learning community that drew engagement than more than 90% of faculty.
         - Successfully coordinated the university's pilot, integration, and rollout of Hypothesis annotation software; through my ongoing outreach and training, consistently more than 30% of WFU students engage with Hypothesis in their classes at some point each semester.
